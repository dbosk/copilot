    abstract = { SUMMARY This paper considers an action‐based approach to the     development of teaching skills in higher education through peer observation and collaborative reflection. The central features of a three‐phase process model are described and explored and the preliminary results of a pilot scheme are reported. From this investigation it is suggested that models of development that are firmly based in existing practice can directly benefit the individual teacher, can enhance colleagiality and can have a significant effect on changing departmental culture. It is acknowledged that insights into personal practice are gained both from the act of observing as well as from being observed. }

    abstract = { SUMMARY Peer observation of teaching is currently receiving widespread interest, and is being implemented in numerous institutions in all sectors of education. There appears to be, however, some uncertainty or controversy over the rationale for this and the role of the observer. In the light of this, we should be very clear about exactly what our objectives are for the implementation of peer observation, and the best way to achieve these, before espousing a potentially divisive and detrimental procedure. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to examine some popular models of peer observation and their potential drawbacks, and to put the case for the implementation of a more active and reflective model, where the focus is less on the observed and more on the active self‐development of the observer. }
