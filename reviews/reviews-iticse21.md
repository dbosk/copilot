To: Richard Glassey <glassey@kth.se>


Dear Richard,

We are pleased to inform you that your submission, When Flying Blind, Bring
a Co-pilot: Informal Peer Observation and Cooperative Teaching During
Remote Teaching, has been accepted for presentation in a Tips, Techniques,
and Courseware session at ITiCSE 2021.

Please begin preparing the final version of your camera-ready submission,
taking carefully into account the following points.

(1) The paper must be formatted using the current ACM templates. If you use
Microsoft Word, please be prepared for a massive challenge in converting
the paper to the current ‘interim’ template. Remember that to use the Word
template you are required to install some new fonts, an instruction that
some authors overlooked for their initial submissions. Some authors have
even decided that it is easier to (re)learn LaTeX and use the LaTeX
template than to fight with the Word template.

(2) The paper is limited to two pages.

(3) You are required to take careful note of the observations in the
reviews, which you will find at the foot of this message.

(4) You should ensure that your submission is edited to eliminate any
typographical or grammatical errors. If necessary, please enlist the help
of somebody who is good with written academic English.

Overall, you should be aware that while your presentation will have a very
short life, these two pages will live on forever in the ACM Digital
Library. Therefore it is important for this submission to encapsulate
everything about your work that you want future readers to know, including
findings if there are any.

Your camera-ready paper will be submitted through Sheridan Communications,
who have set up a website with instructions specific to ITiCSE 2021. Please
work carefully through the information on this website:
http://www.scomminc.com/pp/acmsig/iticseV2.htm

We draw your attention to one point in particular: instruction (c), both
for Word users and for LaTeX users, asks authors to remove the running page
headers (and possibly footers) that were put there by the template, as
Sheridan will be adding the headers themselves.

The hard submission deadline is 25 April 2021 at 23.59 Anywhere on Earth
(UTC-12). No extensions will be given. Kindly attend to your submission
early if you have travel planned near the submission deadline. Camera-ready
papers not submitted on time will not appear in the proceedings.

The lead author (only) of your submission should expect an email from ACM
Rightsreview (rightsreview@acm.org) with a link to the electronic ACM
copyright-permission form to be completed. It might be up to a week before
this email is sent. If you have changed the title of your submission since
submitting it for review, you will need to update the title when completing
the rights review form: the title on that form must match the title on the
camera-ready version of your paper.

After completing the electronic form, you will receive a confirmation email
that will include the ACM copyright-permission block text, conference data,
and DOI string/url specific for your submission, which must appear on the
first page of the paper.

Please note that the publication of your TT&C abstract is contingent on at
least one author registering and attending the virtual conference to
present the poster. We don’t yet know exactly how the presentation of these
papers will be managed at the online conference, but we shall let you know
when the conference chairs have worked that out. We look forward to your
participation at ITiCSE 2021 this June!

TITLE: When Flying Blind, Bring a Co-pilot: Informal Peer Observation and
Cooperative Teaching During Remote Teaching


----------------------- REVIEW 1 ---------------------
SUBMISSION: 392
TITLE: When Flying Blind, Bring a Co-pilot: Informal Peer Observation and
Cooperative Teaching During Remote Teaching
AUTHORS: Daniel Bosk and Richard Glassey

----------- Summary -----------
The paper describes a "co-pilot" model where two educators share the work
for a course, with the "co-pilot" takes care of duties such as managing
(and monitoring) the chat, schedule etc., freeing up the main educator on
focussing on the delivery of the lecture content.
----------- Strengths and weaknesses -----------
Strengths
* Team teaching (in its various forms) is useful if done right, and with
the right partner
* The submission presents enough information on obligations, experiences
made (three different lectures with number of students and setup given,
number of messages per course and lecture).
* The contribution may encourage some educators to try to this approach,
which will mostly likely be of benefit to the students.
* It feels like an honest discussion of the pros and cons - no
counterpoints are actually listed, but from my own experience, if you
choose the right "pilot/co-pilot" team and define the roles well, there are
really no drawbacks, apart from the extra time invested by the co-pilot.

Weaknesses
* None I could find :-)
----------- Value -----------
SCORE: 2 (New perspective, issue, approach, or problem definition)
----------- Suggestions -----------
[Fixed!] I think you also have to add the "Keywords" and "CCS" sections.

[Fixed!] On page 2, directly following the top two bulleted items on the top, 
change "Student's" to "Students",

[Fixed!] and then change "co-pilots experience" to "co-pilot's experience" (in 
the first bullet, starting "You are not alone", in the second bulleted list on 
p. 2).

----------- Overall evaluation -----------
SCORE: 5 (Clear Accept: Content, presentation, and writing meet
professional norms; improvements may be advisable but acceptable as is)
----- TEXT:
Very good approach, well described with experiences and usage data
(courses, setup, number of students, number of chat messages). Makes it
possible - and easy - to "try this out"!



----------------------- REVIEW 2 ---------------------
SUBMISSION: 392
TITLE: When Flying Blind, Bring a Co-pilot: Informal Peer Observation and
Cooperative Teaching During Remote Teaching
AUTHORS: Daniel Bosk and Richard Glassey

----------- Summary -----------
The authors of the paper suggest that teachers cooperate as kind of
co-pilots for each other during online classe and remote teaching
scenarioss. They try to address the novelty of the online mode of teaching
and learning as well as the related challenges due to the Covid-19
pandemic. At the same time, they recommend peer observation and cooperative
teaching to become a more established practice in the CS community.
----------- Strengths and weaknesses -----------
Strenghts:
- cooperative teaching scenarios are highly recommendable from a didactic
perspective and should become a more established practice, indeed


Weaknesses:
- the possible downside of this approach is not mentioned: team-teaching is
more costly itself as two lecturers have to spent their time with the same
number of students. For this reason, not every lecturer and not every
institution cann afford this approach. This consideration should at least
be mentioned.

[It is mentioned: abstract, last paragraph of discussion.]

- Which skills are required from teachers in order to make the cooperative
scenario work? Can you reflect on that? Would this approach work for
everyone?

[Hard to fit such a reflection, but yes, we believe it will work for everyone.]

- I am not sure why the second lecturer was an actual support for "the
pilot" and the students. A teaching assistant could have helped with the
chat during the zoom call, as well.

[Using a TA as co-pilot was one of the three cases.]

I cannot follow the line of arguments. I do not see the actual cooperation. 
Moreover, I would have recommended a collaboarative approach instead of a 
cooperation which is nothing but a division of tasks.

[Sure, there is division of tasks; but it's more a division of focus than 
tasks, they blend at the interaction between pilot and co-pilot.]

- the scenario seems pretty informal and relatively unstructured, which is,
of course, understandable due to the rapid changes last year, but "informal
discussions" as preperation of the academic term are hard to follow.

[Not sure how to interpret this, when students ask questions there is sort of 
an informal discussion with the goal of solving the problem, right?]

- why did the number of messages decrease so rapidly during the semester?
Do you have an explanation for that? And why do you only show data for 10
(C2) and 3 (C3) lectures, when you previously state that there were 13
lectures? (table 1)

[Changed C2 (DD1337) to 10 lectures in the intro, now it's consistent.]

- How did you gather the data which led you to the conclusions of students'
benefits? Are there other conclusions or insights available from the
student evaluation?

[Student benefits was from student evaluations: they got their questions 
answered, that made them happy.]

----------- Value -----------
SCORE: 5 (No significant contribution)
----------- Suggestions -----------
- [Fixed!] typo in the abstract (verb-noun agreement): -> benefits for 
  students, teachers and the co-pilot...
- [Fixed!] "a proactive co-pilot" not an
----------- Overall evaluation -----------
SCORE: 2 (Probable Reject: Basic flaws in content or presentation or very
poorly written)
----- TEXT:
The report offers insights into the implementation of three different CS
classes which had to be adapted due to the pandemic. It seems as if the
authors had jointly given classes before. [No, this was the first time. And it 
was the first time with dbosk's TAs too. Added to text.] I am, therefore, not 
convinced whether this sudden switch to remote teaching would work for just any 
couple of lecturers who may not even know each other.

Moreover, the authors do not reflect well enough on the time cost, the
neither offer a reasonable solution to this huge obstacle. I fully
understand the possible benefits of peer observation, but once, twice or
three times max per semester is more than sufficient to achive the very
same goals. Moreover, it is more easy to realize as hardly any university
has the ressources to let two lecturers facilitate one course.

[Renting a room for a lecture costs *at least* 1200 SEK (up to 4200 SEK) for a 
two hour lecture. A TA costs 300 SEK for the same lecture. Leaving campus and 
going online, I can afford *at least* four TA co-pilots per lecture --- the 
entire course. Added as footnote.]

The concept is also not clearly presented so that I do not see how it can
be applied to other contexts or institutions, or in which regard it offers
added values compared to including a teaching assistant instead of a second
lecturer or professor. Moreover, there is not sufficient data available
from the student survey in order to support the student perspective on the
benefits.
