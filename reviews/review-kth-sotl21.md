Dear Richard,



The conference committee is pleased to inform that your abstract When
flying blind, bring a co-pilot has been accepted for the KTH SoTL 2021
conference in March.



Please consider the feedback from the reviewers when planning your session.
The reviewer comments are visible at the end of this email. KTH SoTL does
not require the authors to submit a full paper. It is essential that at
least one of the authors of the paper is registered and plans to attend the
conference to present this contribution.



Detailed information about the guidelines for your type of session
presentation/workshop/poster can be found at this KTH website

.



KTH SoTL 2021 - Learning Spaces will take place as a virtual conference
March 10, 2021. This is the first time that SoTL is virtual. Instead of
meeting on Campus Valhallav√§gen we will use the Zoom meeting tool for
presentations, workshops, posters and roundtable discussions. You will be
able to find instructions for the different formats on the KTH SoTL 2021
website here
https://intra.kth.se/en/utbildning/utveckling-och-hogskolepedagogik/kth-sotl/conference-kth/information-till-pre
To be able to participate remotely, you need to have access to a stable
network connection, have a good headset with a microphone and a computer
with a built-in camera (alternatively a computer with a camera
attachment). There will be links to every online activity in the program,
you do not need to create the links yourself. We will also invite to
pre-meetings for all formats, where there is an opportunity to brainstorm
ideas about the digital format.

Congratulations on the work you have described in your abstract! We look
forward to your presentation on March 10, 2021, the conference program will
be available from February 17th.



*Best regards*
