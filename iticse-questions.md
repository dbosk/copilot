COMMENT: I did something similar in my courses during the Winter semester, 
using my lead TA as a co-pilot. I highly recommend it. One of the key 
difficulties that I've found with online teaching was covering all of the 
subject matter. Everything seems to take much longer, especially so with the 
repeated questions and digressions in the chat. This practice helped 
substantially with those issues.

Question: Did you feel that the active nature of the chat interaction with the 
co-pilot distracted students from paying attention to the lecture?
